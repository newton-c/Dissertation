All of the false starts, wrongs roads, and other such errors that I make on the path to hopefully writing and defending my dissertation.

The main theme is postconflict crime. I'm interested in positive peace, and hope to contribute to the literature by examing the causes of criminal violence following political conflict. The idea is that "peace" isn't really peace if people stop killing for political reasons only to continue killing for nonpolitical reasons. 

I'm writing three papers in the format of scientific articles looking at the role of media in inciting violence, how the recruitement, resources, and organizational structure of rebel groups continue to have effects after a conflict ends, and how theory-driven machine learning can predict surges in violence - or not - given current data.
