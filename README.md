All of the false starts, wrongs roads, and other such errors that I make on the path to hopefully writing and defending my dissertation.

The main theme ois postconflict crime. I'm interested in positive peace, and hope to coontribute to the literature by examing the causes of criminal violence following political conflict. The idea is that "peace" isn't really peace if people stoped killing people for political reasons only to continue killing for nonpolitical reasons. 

I'm writing three paper in the format of scientific articles looking at the role of media in inciting violence, how the recruitement, resources, and organization structure of rebel groups continue to have effects after a conflict ends, and how theory-driven machine learning can predict surges in violence - or not - given current data.
